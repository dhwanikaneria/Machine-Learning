								** README - Assignment 6 part 3 - Image Clustering **
								*****************************************************

This code is written using Python 2.7.13, but it should work with Python 3.x as well.

We used the following libraries for this code:
1. OpenCV 2.4.11/3.x - for loading, changing colorspaces, displaying and writing images.
2. sklearn - for k-means clustering

The code requires 2 input parameters: number of clusters and image file location URL.

Instructions to run the code:
1. Open cmd/terminal at the location of the file and run by typing in following command.
"python ImageSegmentation.py  number_of_clusters image_path "

2. After running the code, 2 windows with original image and the clustered image will show up. 

Press any key to close the windows and exit the program.
